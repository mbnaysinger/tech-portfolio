    "description": "<strong>Inspired to build robust, scalable, and high-impact digital solutions.</strong> My journey is marked by versatility and the ability to navigate through the entire software development lifecycle, from architectural conception to continuous delivery and production optimization.<br><br>",
    "paragraph1": "<strong>As a hands-on solution architect</strong>, I go beyond designing and proposing architectures: I work directly with development teams, actively participating in implementation, identifying bottlenecks in real-time, and promoting continuous improvements in processes and technologies. I believe that true architecture emerges from close collaboration with those who execute, ensuring that proposed solutions are not only technically solid but also practical and efficient in teams' daily operations.",
    "paragraph2": "<strong>Backend & Frontend Development:</strong> Proficiency in modern ecosystems such as <strong>Java</strong> (with Spring Boot, Quarkus, WebMVC, WebFlux for microservices and reactive architectures), <strong>Node.js</strong> (NestJS, Fastify for high performance), and <strong>PHP</strong> (Laravel for complete web solutions). On the frontend, I develop rich and dynamic interfaces with <strong>Next.js</strong>.",
    "paragraph3": "<strong>Data and Persistence:</strong> Solid experience with relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle), NoSQL (MongoDB, CosmosDB), and caching solutions (Redis), ensuring data performance and integrity.",
    "paragraph4": "<strong>Cloud & DevOps Engineering:</strong> Knowledge in infrastructure and automation on <strong>Azure</strong>, with experience in CI/CD (Jenkins), container orchestration and management (Docker, Kubernetes, Rancher), and monitoring (Grafana). I also master code management (Bitbucket, GitHub) and identity and access solutions (Keycloak).",
    "paragraph5": "Beyond code, I act as a <strong>leader and strategist</strong>, driving teams through agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban. My experience as an IT Project Manager and Product Owner allows me not only to architect and develop systems but also to translate complex business requirements into tangible value deliveries, focusing on innovation and process optimization.",
